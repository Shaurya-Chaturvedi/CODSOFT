# CODSOFT
# Shaurya Chaturvedi - Frontend Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This is a simple yet functional space where I showcase the work I've done, the skills I've built, and a bit about who I am as a developer. I created this site using basic web technologies to keep it lightweight, responsive, and easy to maintain.
